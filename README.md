# Project Description

A realtime real world dashboard to teach middle school students the fundamentals of data visualization using real world / realtime earth data pulled and refreshed from a variety of sources.

### Key Features

- Tutorial to show a user the basics on how to properly use the app.
- Multiple lessons for different aspects of planet earth that are interesting and important.
- Interactive data visualization within each lesson that users can manipulate themselves to see the direct changes in the visualizations.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?
???????????????????????????????????

- Mapbox Js
- D3 Js
- Redux with Redux Toolkit

#### Front end deployed to `üö´insert service here`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/earth-dashboard-be) built using üö´NodeJS and Express

# APIs

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    * REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_STYLE - pulls in styling from a saved mapbox
     map
    * REACT_APP_CONFIRMED_CASES_MAPBOX_TOKEN - needed to access mapbox api to serve
     maps

# Installation Instructions

1.  `yarn install`
2.  `yarn start`

This repo uses git-secrets to prevent to prevent commiting secrets. After
installing packages, install and configure git-secrets:

## git-secrets Instructions

### Step 1: Install to system

#### \*nix (Linux/macOS)

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
make install
```

#### Windows

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets
PS > ./install.ps1
```

#### Homebrew (for macOS users)

`brew install git-secrets`

### Step 2a (DS): Install githooks

```
cd /path/to/your/repo
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --add '^.*pk\..*$'
git secrets --add '^.*postgres://.*$'
```

AWS tokens will be found by default.

'^._pk\.._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with 'pk
.'. This is the basic format of mapbox tokens so those will be found if saved
anywhere in the repo.

'^._postgres://._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with
'postgres://' which should take care of Postgres URLs. If you're using
separate variables for host, user, password, and database, then those
variables will not be detected. Use a URL connection where possible.

### Step 2b (Web): Install githooks

```
cd /path/to/your/repo
git secrets --install -f
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --add '^.*pk\..*$'
git secrets --add '^.*postgres://.*$'
```

AWS tokens will be found by default.

'^._pk\.._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with 'pk
.'. This is the basic format of mapbox tokens so those will be found if saved
anywhere in the repo.

'^._postgres://._\$' is a regex that matches whole strings that start with
'postgres://' which should take care of Postgres URLs. If you're using
separate variables for host, user, password, and database, then those
variables will not be detected. Use a URL connection where possible.

### Step 3 (Web): Reinstall husky hooks

Installing the git-secrets hooks will overwrite those installed by husky so
we need to add those back in.

Open /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit and add the following line at the
bottom of the file:
`. "$(dirname "$0")/husky.sh"`

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
    * format - runs prettier against all files not in .gitignore
    * lint - checks for errors in .js files
    * lint:fix - checks for errors in .js files and fixs those that can be
     auto-fixed
    * prettier: runs prettier
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in watch mode
    * test:CI - test script that runs on Github action for each push and pull
     request
    * test:coverage - runs tests and generates coverage report
    * validate - runs format, lint, build, and test:coverage. Should be run
     prior to submitting pull requests to ensure code adheres to project
      style guidelines, tests pass, and src builds.
